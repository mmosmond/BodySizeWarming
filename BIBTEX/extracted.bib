                   biological communities from impending changes in the
                   environment is an understanding of how communities
                   will respond. General mathematical models of
                   community dynamics are often too simplistic to
                   accurately describe this response, partly to retain
                   mathematical tractability and partly for the lack of
                   biologically pleasing functions representing the
                   model/environment interface. We address these
                   problems of tractability and plausibility in
                   community/environment models by incorporating the
                   Boltzmann factor (temperature dependence) in a
                   bioenergetic consumer-resource framework. Our
                   analysis leads to three predictions for the response
                   of consumer-resource systems to increasing mean
                   temperature (warming). First, mathematical
                   extinctions do not occur with warming; however,
                   stable systems may transition into an unstable
                   (cycling) state. Second, there is a decrease in the
                   biomass density of resources with warming. The
                   biomass density of consumers may increase or decrease
                   depending on their proximity to the feasibility
                   (extinction) boundary. Third, consumer biomass
                   density is more sensitive to warming than resource
                   biomass density (with some exceptions). These
                   predictions are in line with many current
                   observations and experiments. The model presented and
                   analyzed here provides an advancement in the testing

                   tests of how warming affects species' abundance and
                   performance. As this body of research grows,
                   interpretation and extrapolation to other species and
                   systems have been limited by a lack of theory. To
                   address the need for theory for how warming affects
                   species interactions, we used consumer-prey models
                   and the metabolic theory of ecology to develop
                   quantitative predictions for how systematic
                   differences between the temperature dependence of
                   heterotrophic and autotrophic population growth lead
                   to temperature-dependent herbivory. We found that
                   herbivore and plant abundances change with
                   temperature in proportion to the ratio of autotrophic
                   to heterotrophic metabolic temperature dependences.
                   This result is consistent across five different
                   formulations of consumer-prey models and over varying
                   resource supply rates. Two models predict that
                   temperature-dependent herbivory causes primary
                   producer abundance to be independent of temperature.
                   This finding contradicts simpler extensions of
                   metabolic theory to abundance that ignore trophic
                   interactions, and is consistent with patterns in
                   terrestrial ecosystems. When applied to experimental
                   data, the model explained 77{\%} and 66{\%} of the
                   variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton
                   abundances, respectively. We suggest that metabolic
                   theory provides a foundation for understanding the
                   effects of temperature change on multitrophic
                   ecological communities.},

                   populations and food webs by changing the interaction
                   strengths between predators and their prey.
                   Predicting the consequences of warming requires
                   understanding how temperature affects ingestion
                   (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we
                   studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and
                   ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial
                   arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we
                   calculated ingestion efficiencies
                   (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interac- tion
                   strengths in the short and long term. Additionally,we
                   investigated if and how body mass changes these
                   temperature dependencies. For both predator groups,
                   warming increased metabolic rates substantially,
                   whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were
                   weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the
                   ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all
                   treatments. This result has two possible
                   consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that
                   warming of natural ecosystems could increase
                   intrinsic population stability, meaning less
                   fluctuations in population density; on the other
                   hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead
                   to higher extinction risks because of starvation.
                   Additionally, predicted long-term per capita
                   interaction strengths decreased with warming, which
                   suggests an increase in perturbation stability of
                   populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning
                   to the same equilibrium density after a small
                   perturbation. Together, these results suggest that
                   warming has complex and potentially profound effects
                   on predatorprey interactions and food-web stability.},

                   the proportion of small-sized species and young age

  abstract =      {Trophic cascades are indirect positive effects of
                   predators on resources via control of intermediate
                   consumers. Larger-bodied predators appear to induce
                   stronger trophic cascades (a greater rebound of
                   resource density toward carrying capacity), but how
                   this happens is unknown because we lack a clear
                   depiction of how the strength of trophic cascades is
                   determined. Using consumer resource models, we first
                   show that the strength of a trophic cascade has an
                   upper limit set by the interaction strength between
                   the basal trophic group and its consumer and that
                   this limit is approached as the interaction strength
                   between the consumer and its predator increases. We
                   then express the strength of a trophic cascade
                   explicitly in terms of predator body size and use two
                   independent parameter sets to calculate how the
                   strength of a trophic cascade depends on predator
                   size. Both parameter sets predict a positive effect
                   of predator size on the strength of a trophic
                   cascade, driven mostly by the body size dependence of
                   the interaction strength between the first two
                   trophic levels. Our results support previous
                   empirical findings and suggest that the loss of
                   larger predators will have greater consequences on
                   trophic control and biomass structure in food webs
                   than the loss of smaller predators.},

                   functional responses) and the distribution of body
                   masses across species. Until now, these two aspects
                   have almost exclusively been treated separately
                   leaving a substantial gap in our general
                   understanding of food webs. We analysed a large data
                   set of arthropod feeding rates and found that all
                   functional-response parameters depend on the body
                   masses of predator and prey. Thus, we propose
                   generalised functional responses which predict
                   gradual shifts from type-II predation of small
                   predators on equally sized prey to type-III
                   functional-responses of large predators on small
                   prey. Models including these generalised functional
                   responses predict population dynamics and persistence
                   only depending on predator and prey body masses, and
                   we show that these predictions are strongly supported
                   by empirical data on forest soil food webs. These
                   results help unravelling systematic relationships

  abstract =      {Most ectothermic organisms mature at smaller body
                   sizes when reared in warmer conditions. This
                   phenotypically plastic response, known as the
                   "temperature-size rule" (TSR), is one of the most
                   taxonomically widespread patterns in biology.
                   However, the TSR remains a longstanding life-history
                   puzzle for which no dominant driver has been found.
                   We propose that oxygen supply plays a central role in
                   explaining the magnitude of ectothermic
                   temperature-size responses. Given the much lower
                   oxygen availability and greater effort required to
                   increase uptake in water vs. air, we predict that the
                   TSR in aquatic organisms, especially larger species
                   with lower surface area-body mass ratios, will be
                   stronger than in terrestrial organisms. We performed
                   a meta-analysis of 1,890 body mass responses to
                   temperature in controlled experiments on 169
                   terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. This
                   reveals that the strength of the temperature-size
                   response is greater in aquatic than terrestrial
                   species. In animal species of ∼100 mg dry mass, the
                   temperature-size response of aquatic organisms is 10
                   times greater than in terrestrial organisms (-5.0{\%}
                   °C(-1) vs. -0.5{\%} °C(-1)). Moreover, although the
                   size response of small ({\textless}0.1 mg dry mass)
                   aquatic and terrestrial species is similar, increases
                   in species size cause the response to become
                   increasingly negative in aquatic species, as
                   predicted, but on average less negative in
                   terrestrial species. These results support oxygen as
                   a major driver of temperature-size responses in
                   aquatic organisms. Further, the environment-dependent
                   differences parallel latitudinal body size clines,
                   and will influence predicted impacts of climate
                   warming on food production, community structure, and
                   food-web dynamics.},

                   index of mass-specific resource demand) and cell size
                   across three environmental temperatures. I controlled

                   of ecosystems and biodiversity. Feeding rates, as all
                   biological rates, depend on consumer and resource
                   body masses and environmental temperature. Despite
                   five decades of research on functional responses as
                   quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying
                   framework of how they scale with body masses and
                   temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing,
                   considering that the strength of functional responses
                   (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important
                   for the stability of simple consumer-resource systems
                   and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity
                   of complex communities. Here, we present the largest
                   currently available database on functional response
                   parameters and their scaling with body mass and
                   temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated
                   across ecosystems and metabolic types of species.
                   Surprisingly, we found general temperature
                   dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms
                   predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the
                   body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex
                   than expected and differed across ecosystems and
                   metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically
                   narrow groups of consumer-resource pairs), we found
                   hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and
                   body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the
                   complexity of our results, these body-mass- and
                   temperature-scaling models remain useful as a
                   mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of
                   warming for interaction strengths, population
                   dynamics and network stability across communities
